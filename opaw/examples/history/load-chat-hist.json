GPT-3: OpenAI's most famous creation is the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3). It is a state-of-the-art language model capable of generating human-like text responses, expanding on prompts, and performing a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n\n2. Codex: OpenAI developed Codex, a language model trained on a large amount of publicly available code, to assist developers in writing code quickly. It enables users to provide a description or prompt and generates code snippets that align with the given instructions.\n\n3. DALL\u00b7E: OpenAI's DALL\u00b7E is a neural network-based model capable of generating images from text descriptions. Given a textual prompt, DALL\u00b7E can create unique and often surreal images that relate to the given description.\n\nAside from these specific products, OpenAI continually researches and develops new AI technologies, models, and frameworks, often focusing on language processing, reinforcement learning, and generalized artificially intelligent systems."
